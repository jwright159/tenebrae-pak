# RPG sxample mappack for Tenebrae Engine
This mappack contains a lot of code that is either way outdated or has features that aren't implemented yet, but it should contain enough sample code to do some basic RPG tasks.

Most of the assets are free assets I found online via Google. Music and some assets are ripped from Undertale.
