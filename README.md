# Advanced entity functionality sample mappack for Tenebrae Engine
This is a complete bullet-hell-style mappack with inspiration from Undertale and Just Shapes and Beats.
All assets (except for the flat UI theme for libGDX) are original and based on Lo2, another project of mine. It is a fight between Jay (the player) and the characters Typer and Tesla.
Sprites for Typer and Tesla created by Muffincat. Player sprite by me.
Music created by me, unmastered.
