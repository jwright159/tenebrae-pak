I need spites of Typer and Tesla for a Sans-like fight
So like 45deg athletic/battle stances or something
I need individual moving parts though, so I can animate them (eg. torso, arms, legs, ears, head would all be seperate)
Pixel or smooth idc
But they shuld be toony and mostly outlined in an accent color

Typer:
Blue furry longboy
Main weapon is a long staff
I need mostly anthro but also like one feral
I have the canonalized 3d models for any refs you need anyway
Poses:
1. static assertive stance of glaring at viewer
- also one w right hand opened w fingers in magic fire
2. static anime foreboding stance (like where the whole top half of the face is shadowed)
3. anim sequence for throwing staves: stance holding nothing -> right arm holding staff to throw -> left arm holding another staff -> both arms in thrown position
- hands must be seperate from arms, need to rotate them individually (can be rectangles for all I care)
- also need just a sprite of a staff for mid-flight in Ty's staff color, but also 2 in Tes's primary colors (can be rectangles for all I care)
4. floating in air w eyes glowing + phi eye
5. athletic/fighting stance w magic fire hands w more parts that I can animate on loop
- also one with phi eye
6. feral flying pose w a repeatable segment part

Tesla:
Generic wolf furry
I know most of her pallete but idk
I also have like no refs so
1. standing straight, one arm out palm out in 4 different positions at corners of a square
- also another other arm sprite w casting phi
2. same as main of #1 but in an athletic stance
- also one w magic fire fingers
- one more w magic + casting phi
3. same as main of Ty#1
- also just like 2 sprite parts of each wing
